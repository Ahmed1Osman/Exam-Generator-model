# Automated MCQ Generation Models: Llama-3B-QA-Enhanced & ExamGen

This repository contains two fine-tuned models for generating multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from educational text:

1. **Llama-3B-QA-Enhanced**: A fine-tuned version of Llama 3B optimized for MCQ generation using both the **SQuAD** and **RACE** datasets.
2. **ExamGen**: A version fine-tuned on the **SQuAD** dataset to generate MCQs specifically from question-answer pairs.

Both models are designed to assist educators, content creators, and platforms in generating high-quality MCQs for assessments, quizzes, and educational content development.
